# Search As You Type Using SQL

Search-as-you-type has become an essential feature for online marketplaces, search engines, recommendation systems, etc., as it improves user engagement and helps users find relevant information quickly. Search-as-you-type or autocomplete predicts the search key in real time while users type their search queries. Many applications like Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc. offer this feature to help customers find their search results quickly and easily.

Our aim is to implement the prototype solution presented in the paper, which utilizes the full potential of the query engine and auxiliary tables to improve search performance.
